<h1>Introduction</h1>

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves using statistical and visualization techniques to describe data and highlight
important aspects for further analysis. It includes examining the dataset from various perspectives, summarizing it
without assuming anything about its contents.

<h1>Explaining the code</h1>

This code runs on a pre-configured performance test dataset consisting KPIs such as Average Response Time,
90th Percentile Response Time, Throughput and Latency.

With the help of numpy, pandas, seaborn python libraries we have made basic commands with an intention to understand the
basics of EDA and further could be used for integrating with LLM. (<i>This will be discussed later</i>)
