<h1>Introduction</h1>

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves using statistical and visualization techniques to describe data and highlight
important aspects for further analysis. It includes examining the dataset from various perspectives, summarizing it
without assuming anything about its contents.

<h1>Explaining the code</h1>

This code operates on a pre-set performance test dataset that includes KPIs like Average Response Time,
90th Percentile Response Time, Throughput, and Latency.

We have utilized numpy, pandas, and seaborn python libraries to execute fundamental commands in order to grasp
the fundamentals of EDA. These commands can also be employed for seamless integration with LLM.
